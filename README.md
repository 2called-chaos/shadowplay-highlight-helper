# ShadowPlay Highlight Helper

ShadowPlay Highlight Helper (SHH, I know it's like SSH and I typo'd that way to often) is a little electron powered application aimed at helping you manage your gaming highlights recorded with Nvidia's ShadowPlay: name your recordings, give it tags, trim it, transcode it.

# This app is in pre-alpha development, don't use yet!
